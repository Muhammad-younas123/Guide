# GIT and GITHUB Guide

## Introduction to Git and GitHub

### Git
Git is a version control system used to track files. It is free and open-source software.

### GitHub
GitHub is an online web-based service to host Git repositories, allowing you to share your code with others.

## Installing Git

To install Git, visit [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and select "Download for Windows" if you are on Windows. Otherwise, select the appropriate download for your system.

## Git Commands

### Checking Git Version
```bash
git --version

Repository
A repository is just a folder that keeps your files. In Git terminology, we call it a "repo."
Git Status

Configuring Git Settings
To configure your settings, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

git config --list
Creating a Repository
Initializing a Repository
To create a repository, initialize it using the git init command.

Staging and Committing Changes
Write your code in the file.
Add it to the staging area using the git add command.
Commit it to the repo using the git commit command.
Pushing to GitHub
To push your code to GitHub, use the git push command.

Committing with a Message

One-line Log
bash
Copy code
git log --oneline
Shows a one-line summary of the commit history.

Git Ignore
.gitignore is a file that contains the files you want Git to ignore.

Working with Branches
Branches are a way to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. They allow you to create a separate line of development independent of the main branch.

Head
HEAD is the pointer that points to the current branch.

Branch Commands

bash
Copy code
git merge branchname
Rename a Branch

bash
Copy code
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
Delete a Branch

bash
Copy code
git branch -d branchname
Comparing Changes with Git Diff
Git Diff Commands

Compare two specific commits:

bash
Copy code
git diff commit-hash-one commit-hash-two
Stashing Changes with Git Stash
Git Stash Commands
Save changes to a temporary location:

bash

Copy code
git stash clear

git rebase branchname
Viewing Commit History with Git Reflog

bash
Copy code
git reflog
